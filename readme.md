# Name
I'm *Sam Allen*!

## What I'm hoping to learn
I'm excited to learn about **Data Structures**. I'm also taking an **Intro to _Data Analytics_ class**, a ***Discrete Structures***, and a Chemical Analysis<sub>which means I'm very busy</sub>, which I find super interesting<sup>and honestly just fun</sup> and all directly connect to the field that I think I want to go into in addition to just being extremely mathy! 

### Something interesting about me
Something that I think is interesting about me is that I have many different interests that I'm all passionate about. <ins>I love to read about politics and economics, I play Clarinet and Piano, and I do origami and other crafts!</ins>

>My favorite color is either...
* purple
or
- green. 
There are some really good shades of both that go well together.
